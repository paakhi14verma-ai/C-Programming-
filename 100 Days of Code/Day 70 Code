str = I am trying to build logic.
Output 1:
I Am Trying To Build Logic

Output 2:
The Classes Are Supposed To Start Early.

Input 3:
str = We are going to look at 26 different test cases.
Output 3:
We Are Going To Look At 26 Different Test Cases.

Code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main() {
    char str[200];
    int i;

    printf("Enter a string: ");
    fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);

    if (str[0] >= 'a' && str[0] <= 'z')
        str[0] = str[0] - 32;

    for (i = 1; str[i] != '\0'; i++) {
       
        if (str[i - 1] == ' ' && str[i] >= 'a' && str[i] <= 'z') {
            str[i] = str[i] - 32;
        }
    }

    printf("%s", str);
